# Patch Notes - 2026-06-02 Safe Sync (PC vs GitHub Research)

**Project:** The-Last-Arrow (The Last Arrow project)
**Path:** C:\Projetos\The-Last-Arrow
**Branch:** main (push: origin)
**Generated:** 2026-06-02 11:42:57
**State:** docs | Pre-rebase state: docs | Ahead/Behind post: +0 / -0

## Executive Summary
Batch safe commit for projects with 24h activity (file mods, commits, dirty tree, or agent-driven patch/changelog touches). Research performed locally via git (fetch, rev-list, diff, status, stash/rebase) comparing current PC working tree + HEAD against GitHub remote (origin/main).

This snapshot captures all local mutations since last synced safe commit (typically 05-31). Includes work from parallel agent sessions (Grok, Claude, sub-agents, /loop etc.). Conflicts (if any during rebase to integrate latest GitHub) were resolved preferring **--ours (PC/local version)** to preserve the authoritative state on this machine.

Key stats: 24h commits present=no, dirty=yes, stashed=True, rebased=False, conflicts-resolved=False, rebase-aborted=False.

## Local PC vs GitHub Comparison (Post-Reconciliation Research)

| Aspect | PC (Local) | GitHub (origin) | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| HEAD | a8e2b92 | a8e2b92 | Post-rebase if applied |
| Branch tracking | main | origin/main | |
| Ahead / Behind | +0 | -0 | 0/0 ideal after rebase |
| Working tree | dirty (17 lines) | (remote clean by definition) | Uncommitted on PC |
| Unique commits (24h) | 0 listed | See div below | |
| Divergence PC-only commits | 0 | - | These + uncommitted = what we commit |
| Divergence GH-only | - | 0 | Integrated via rebase (or ignored if aborted) |

### Commits unique to PC (will be part of this safe commit or already in HEAD)
(none - all local work is uncommitted or already matched)

### Commits only on GitHub (fetched, integrated where possible)
(none - PC was at or ahead of remote at research time)

### Recent 24h local commits (full subjects + relative time)
  (no new commits in last 24h; changes are uncommitted or from prior)

### Pending uncommitted changes on PC (porcelain post-rebase/pop)

## Multi-Agent Parallel Work & Conflict Handling
Many agents (Grok 4.3, Claude, specialized sub-agents, background loops, best-of-n, implement/review loops) operated in parallel across the 23 active projects.
Observed artifacts: simultaneous edits to patchnotes.md/changelog.md (timestamp ~10:05), .codegraph/ db updates (indexing), source in Kamui/Yume/Terminal/Sennin/simple-ai/VideoGen/LUCA, heavy data/job writes (OmniVoiceDash), recent feature commits (nexarq ~40 commits with detailed feat/fix messages), .bak experiment files, agent handoff mds, heartbeat/state json.

Reconciliation strategy used here:
- git fetch --all to pull latest GitHub (other agents or CI may have pushed).
- Stash uncommitted PC work.
- Rebase onto origin/main (preferring GitHub base).
- On CONFLICT: checkout --ours + add (PC local wins for the snapshot of 'what is on this machine now').
- Pop stash. This ensures the safe commit represents the authoritative PC reality on top of (or reconciled with) GitHub.
- If rebase aborted: still proceed with commit of current PC tree (safe, no data loss).
- Uniform detailed patchnotes + changelog written before the git add -A + commit.

No hard unresolvable conflicts left; state includes 'conflict-resolved' or 'rebase-aborted' flags where applicable. Cross-project overlaps (grokassets, AGENTS.md, brand, docs) handled by consistent formatting.

## Conclusion & Next
PC version researched and documented vs GitHub. All qualifying mutations (code, docs, data from agent runs, experiments) staged for the **2026-06-02+docs safe commit**.
Push target: origin (may be backup/safe for non-primary forks or to avoid affecting public upstreams like sub2api).
See changelog.md for the concise entry. Prior history preserved below the --- marker.
